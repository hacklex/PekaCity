# PekaCity
2D game stub rendered completely in WPF

# What is this? Why?

Well, this is a stub for a 2D game. The purpose of the project was
to demonstrate that one can write a 2D game in WPF without writing
any rendering code.

# Features

* 2D Tiles. Not yet animated, but animating won't be a problem, I guess
* Cell-aligned game objects
* No rendering code, everything is done using WPF data binding and a few ValueConverters

# Disclaimer

You can use both the code and the graphics, I don't mind.
